This is a comprehensive outline for my code and this is essential for making it understandable, maintainable, and easy to onboard new readers. Here's a detailed blueprint of the project

**Bank Management System**

**1. Introduction**
The Bank Management System is a simple C++ application designed to manage customer accounts. This documentation provides an overview of the code structure, its purpose, and how to use it.

**2. Class Overview**
The code consists of a single class named `Bank`, which serves as the core component of the Bank Management System. This class contains private data members to store customer information and provides several methods to interact with this data.

**3. Main Function**
The `main()` function initializes an instance of the `Bank` class and calls the `choice()` method, which provides a menu for user interaction.

 **4. Class Methods**
 
 -->**4.1. `choice()`**
    Description: Displays a menu of options for the user to choose from and handles user input to execute various operations related to the bank management system.

 -->**4.2. `perData()`**
	Description: Allows the user to input data for a new customer account, including their name, ID, address, contact information, and cash balance.
	
-->**4.3. `show()`**
	Displays a list of all customer accounts along with their details, such as name, ID, address, contact, and cash balance.
	
-->**4.4. `update()`**
	Description: Allows the user to update the information of an existing customer account by specifying the account ID. Users can modify the name, ID, address, contact, and cash balance.
	
-->**4.5. `search()`**
	Description:Enables users to search for a specific customer account by providing its ID. If found, it displays the account's details, including name, ID, address, contact, and cash balance.
	
-->**4.6. `transactions()`**
	Description:Allows users to perform transactions on a customer account, such as depositing or withdrawing cash. Users must provide the account ID, and the system displays the account details and prompts for the type of transaction.
	
-->**4.7. `del()`**
	Description:Provides options to remove customer records. Users can either delete a specific record by providing the account ID or clear all records.

**5. Conclusion**

This Bank Management System in C++ offers basic functionality to create, view, update, search, transact, and delete customer accounts. It can serve as a starting point for developing a more comprehensive banking application. The code is modular, making it easy to understand and maintain.
