The Bank Management System project is a simple console-based C++ application designed to manage customer accounts for a hypothetical bank. It allows users to perform various operations related to customer accounts, including creating new accounts, viewing customer lists, updating customer information, searching for specific accounts, conducting transactions (deposits and withdrawals), and deleting customer records.

The project's main features include:

1. **Create New Account:** Users can input customer information, including name, ID, address, contact details, and initial cash balance, to create new customer accounts.

2. **View Customer Lists:** The system can display a list of all existing customer accounts, providing details such as name, ID, address, contact information, and cash balance.

3. **Update Customer Information:** Users can modify the information of existing customer accounts by specifying the account ID. They can update the customer's name, ID, address, contact details, and cash balance.

4. **Search for Accounts:** The system allows users to search for specific customer accounts by entering their account ID. If found, it displays detailed account information.

5. **Transactions:** Users can perform financial transactions on customer accounts, including depositing and withdrawing cash. The system verifies the available balance and updates it accordingly.

6. **Delete Records:** Users have the option to delete customer records. They can either remove a specific record by providing the account ID or clear all records.

This project serves as a basic template for a bank management system and can be further developed to include more advanced features such as interest calculations, account types, and user authentication. It is designed to be user-friendly, with a menu-driven interface, making it accessible for both bank employees and customers.
